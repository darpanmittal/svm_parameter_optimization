# svm_parameter_optimization

In this project, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in solving classification problems by optimizing SVM parameters. We implemented our SVM model using the Scikit-learn library in Python and tested it on the room occupancy Data Set. To ensure robustness of our analysis, we randomly split the dataset into 10 samples for training and testing. We experimented with different combinations of SVM parameters for each sample to identify the optimal settings. The results, presented in a tabular form, highlight the accuracy achieved for each sample and the corresponding SVM parameters that resulted in the highest accuracy. This table can serve as a valuable reference for future classification tasks that require SVM parameter optimization.

# Dataset Description

The "Room Occupancy Estimation Data Set" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of 20,560 instances with 7 features including temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, CO2 level, humidity ratio, and occupancy status (binary label). This dataset is often used for binary classification tasks to predict room occupancy based on sensor measurements, making it valuable for research and development in areas such as energy management in buildings, smart homes, and other similar environments. It serves as a useful resource for evaluating and comparing different machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), for estimating room occupancy.
